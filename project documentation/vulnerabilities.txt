Basic Problems:
1. Host Discovery Issues:
   - Floodlight controller sometimes fails to discover all hosts in the network
   - Results in incomplete path computation and failed connectivity tests
   - Affects both SPS and load balancer functionality

Vulnerabilities in SPS Implementation:
1. Null Switch References
   - Hosts may have null switch references during topology changes
   - Occurs when switches are removed or links go down
   - Can cause NullPointerException in path computation
   - No proper exception handling for orphaned hosts

2. Performance Issues
   - Complete path recomputation on any topology change
   - Bellman-Ford algorithm runs for all hosts even with minor changes
   - High computational overhead in large networks
   - No caching or incremental update mechanism

3. Edge Case Handling
   - Potential infinite loop in path computation with negative cycles
   - No validation for maximum path length
   - Missing checks for disconnected network segments

Vulnerabilities in Load Balancer Implementation:
1. TCP Connection Management
   - Rule installation for TCP SYN packets can trigger null exceptions
   - Inconsistent behavior in rule installation timing
   - Possible race conditions in connection handling

2. Resource Management
   - No limit on number of concurrent connections
   - Fixed 20-second idle timeout may not suit all scenarios
   - No cleanup mechanism for stale connection entries

3. Host Selection
   - Simple round-robin without health checks
   - No consideration of host load or capacity
   - No backup host mechanism for failed servers
